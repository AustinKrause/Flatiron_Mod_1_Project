<b>Project Goals:</b><br>
  -scrape data from Rotten Tomatoes and use titles as a base dataframe<br>
  -use aspects of the scraped data to make API requests on IMDB, OMDB and TMDB<br>
  -find relationships within our data to describe what types of movies may return higher revenue/profits<br>
  -give insights based on what questions our data answered<br>
  -find what movie ratings return higher profits/revenues<br>
  -decipher whether critical movie reviews or popular opinion influence profits<br>

<b>Questions to be answered:</b><br>
  -Does Rotten Score or Metascore have an overall impact on profitability of a movie?<br>
  -Are there trends in profitibility based on movie ratings (G, PG, PG-13, R)? <br>
  -Does accessibility of seeing a movie bring higher profits?<br>
  <br>
<b>Going forward:</b><br>
  -Utilize data from that we scraped from BoxOfficeMojo<br>
  -Compare our findings with findings in the new data<br>
  -expand range of movie years beyond 2009-2018<br>
