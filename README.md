  -Use Pandas to get useful statistics for comparing films<br>
  -Posted to git repo<br>
  -A readme listing lab members, project goals, etc<br>
  -A Jupyter notebook of clean and commented code so an independent party canreplicate your analysis<br>
  -Your final joined and cleaned dataset that was used for analysis, a narrative Jupyter notebook that provides: The purpose      of your analysis and why it matters<br>
  -4 well annotated visualizations created using Matplotlib/Seaborn<br>
  -4 meaningful summary tables<br>
  -Give at least two actionable insights (What type of films should they belooking to produce? <br>
    ex: What should the budget requirements be? Shouldthey recruit certain actors for their films?<br>
<br>
Project Goals:<br>
  -scrape data from Rotten Tomatoes and use titles as a base dataframe<br>
  -use aspects of the scraped data to make API requests on IMDB, OMDB and TMDB<br>
  -find relationships within our data to describe what types of movies may return higher revenue/profits<br>
  -give insights based on what questions our data answered<br>
  -find what movie ratings return higher profits/revenues<br>
  -decipher whether critical movie reviews or popular opinion influence profits<br>
