  -Use Pandas to get useful statistics for comparing films
  -Posted to git repo
  -A readme listing lab members, project goals, etc
  -A Jupyter notebook of clean and commented code so an independent party canreplicate your analysis
  -Your final joined and cleaned dataset that was used for analysis, a narrative Jupyter notebook that provides: The purpose      of your analysis and why it matters

  -find relationships within our data to describe what types of movies may return higher revenue/profits
  -give insights based on what questions our data answered
  -find what movie ratings return higher profits/revenues
  -decipher whether critical movie reviews or popular opinion influence profits
